**Continuous Integration (CI)** is a central process of agile development and Tizen Mobile App development is not an exception. The CI allows automating many stages of your process, such as triggering build of your app when new source code is submitted on the repository, storing a newly built artifact on a permanent storage, distributing that artifact among your testers and end users. The CI generates also plenty of management information and links your code with your stories and tasks allowing wide collaboration on code and builds.
