========================================

**Microsoft Mobile Center** is mission control for mobile apps. Get faster release cycles, higher-quality apps, and the insights to build what users want.
One of the Services, the Mobile Center Analytics helps you understand user behavior and customer engagement to improve your app. The SDK automatically captures session count, device properties like model, OS version, etc. You can define your own custom events to measure things that matter to you. All the information captured is available in the Mobile Center portal for you to analyze the data.

**Continuous Integration (CI)** is a central process of agile development and Tizen Mobile App development is not an exception. The CI allows automating many stages of your process, such as triggering build of your app when new source code is submitted on the repository, storing a newly built artifact on a permanent storage, distributing that artifact among your testers and end users. The CI generates also plenty of management information and links your code with your stories and tasks allowing wide collaboration on code and builds.
