Creating Tizen Apps with modern .NET C# APIs
============================================


**This is an introduction post by Alex Shulga and Siddarth KM**


**Tizen** app development process got [more fun and productive](https://www.tizenexperts.com/2016/11/dev-c-getting-started-with-visual-studio-tools-tizen-preview/) when the
[Tizen .NET Developer Preview](https://developer.tizen.org/development/tizen-.net-preview/introduction) was announced.

		<td>Now, additionally to C and Java Script APIs, you can use C# and Xamarin APIs, which allows you to create cross-platform apps targeting smartphones, TVs, and wearables running different operating systems.</td>
	</tr>
</table>

These pieces of software, mainly distributed as the Open Source, will offer wide variety of useful features which can be quickly and smoothly integrated in your app via GUI of packet manager.
The programmer-oriented sets of .NET SDKs will allow applying in your app development process some modern techniques, such as
[Test Driven Development (TDD)](https://shulgaalexey.github.io/gallery-dotnet-sdk-tizen/TDDWithNUnitXamarin.html) and
[Continuous Integration (CI)](https://shulgaalexey.github.io/gallery-dotnet-sdk-tizen/IBMWatsonConversation.html).


Potentially endless list of Nuget packages and GitHub repos, compatible with Tizen, will rocket your app development life cycle and open new opportunities to innovate,
focus on user experience, and concentrate on delivering new features.


It should be noted, although, that the flexibility and "cross-platformity" of .NET are not given for free:
issues caused by [frameworks, platforms, and standards](https://github.com/dotnet/standard/blob/master/docs/versions.md) incompatibilities are the everyday reality for cross-platform developers and,
unfortunately, Tizen app developers are not an exception.


----------------


## Today we are presenting the [Gallery of 3rd Party C# APIs and SDKs](https://shulgaalexey.github.io/gallery-dotnet-sdk-tizen/) tailored for Tizen Mobile and TV .NET Apps.


----------------


The lightweight Gallery, organized as a vintage Web 1.0-ish blog, comprising a basic set of Tizen-ready 3rd Party C# APIs. Selected and ported by us to Tizen .NET, those APIs and SDKs are accompanied with developer tutorials, framed as short stories and helping you getting started with a particular package and Tizen .NET App development in common.
