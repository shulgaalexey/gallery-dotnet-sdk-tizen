Are you developing Tizen Xamarin App and looking for a TDD framework?

Do you use NUnit TDD solutions on other mobile platforms and planning to integrate it on Tizen too?

Are you studying TDD the very first time?

Read this step-by-step guide where you will find a detailed instructions on how to use nunit.xamarin test framework which is a cross-platform SDK with GUI and report generation features.

For the comprehensive NUnit feature coverage, please, visit the [project site](http://nunit.org/).

*Note. By the end of 2017 Tizen .NET and Tizen Xamarin Mobile and TV Apps are available in the Preview mode.*




## What is TDD?




## How to get started?

First of all, we assume that you already have basic knowledge in Tizen Xamarin App development. For basic information, see [https://developer.tizen.org/development/preview/getting-started](https://developer.tizen.org/development/preview/getting-started).

For the instructions how to install Visual Studio Tools for Tizen, see [https://developer.tizen.org/development/tizen-.net-preview/getting-started/installing-visual-studio-tools-tizen](https://developer.tizen.org/development/tizen-.net-preview/getting-started/installing-visual-studio-tools-tizen).





## 1. Integrating nunit.xamarin in your project

### Code ninja way

TODO: Building nunit.xamarin out of sources from the GitHub


### You are the Boss of Continuous Integration

TODO: adding via nupkgs from the MyGet
TODO: add link to the CI article



## 2. Preparing test cases 




## 3. Checking test report


### Quick glance on the GUI


### XML report






## What we learned today?

You can and, very likely, should develop your Tizen Mobile or TV App in a TDD manner. 

We propose to use nunit.xamarin SDK which offers testing capcities of popular NUnit Framework together with GUI and XML reporting features.

Tizen .NET and Tizen Xamarin Mobile and TV Apps are in the Preview mode and you can try it free of charge.
Give it a try and develop your own well tested world class apps.
