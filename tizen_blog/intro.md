Gallery of Tizen-compatible .NET C# SDKs
========================================

**Tizen** app development process got [more fun and productive](https://www.tizenexperts.com/2016/11/dev-c-getting-started-with-visual-studio-tools-tizen-preview/) when the
[Tizen .NET Developer Preview](https://developer.tizen.org/development/tizen-.net-preview/introduction) was announced.


<table style="width:100%" align="left" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
	<tr>
		<td style="width:530px"><a href="https://developer.tizen.org/development/tizen-.net-preview/introduction"><img src="https://developer.tizen.org/sites/default/files/images/tizen_dotnet_preview4_1089x318.png" alt="Tizen .NET Preview 4"  width="500" /></a></td>
		<td>Now, additionally to C and Java Script APIs, you can use C# and Xamarin APIs, which allows you to create cross-platform apps targeting smartphones, TVs, and wearables running different operating systems.</td>
	</tr>
</table>

These pieces of software, the majority of which are distributed as the Open Source, will allow you to add needed features to your app quickly and smoothly.
The programmer-oriented sets of SDKs will allow applying in your app development process some modern techniques, such as 
[Test Driven Development (TDD)](https://shulgaalexey.github.io/gallery-dotnet-sdk-tizen/TDDWithNUnitXamarin.html) and
[Continuous Integration (CI)](https://shulgaalexey.github.io/gallery-dotnet-sdk-tizen/IBMWatsonConversation.html).


Potentially endless list of Nuget packages and GitHub repos, compatible with Tizen, will rocket your app development life cycle and open new opportunities to innovate,
focus on user experience, and concentrate on delivering new features.


It should be noted, although, that the flexibility and "cross-platformity" of .NET are not given for free:
issues caused by [frameworks, platforms, and standards](https://github.com/dotnet/standard/blob/master/docs/versions.md) incompatibilities are the everyday reality for cross-platform developers and,
unfortunately, Tizen app developers are not an exception.

## Today we are presenting the [Gallery of 3rd Party C# APIs and SDKs](https://shulgaalexey.github.io/gallery-dotnet-sdk-tizen/) tailored for Tizen Mobile and TV .NET Apps.
